# CS3520-Final 
The username for the default lead for the project is "bernie". New members can be manually added to the proj.txt file below user bernie and before the I% marker. Make sure to also add this user to the users.txt file as well. The format will be included at the bottom of the file.

You can also register new users in the application, but they will not be added to the project unless a lead adds them.

Format (proj.txt):

- username
- role (0 for LEAD, 1 for MEMBER)
