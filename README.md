# CS3520-Final 
The username for the default lead for the project is "andrew". New members can be manually added to the proj.txt file below user andrew and before the I% marker. Make sure to also add this user to the users.txt file as well. The format will be included at the bottom of the file.

You can also register new users in the application, but they will not be added to the project unless a lead adds them.

3.txt contains a back-up of the proj.txt files in case you delete the project and don't want to create and populate a new one. This is an example project with a few sprints and issues.

Format (proj.txt):

- username
- role (0 for LEAD, 1 for MEMBER)
